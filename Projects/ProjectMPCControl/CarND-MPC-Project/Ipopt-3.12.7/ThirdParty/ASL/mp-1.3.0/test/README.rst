This directory contains tests implemented using the
`Google C++ Testing Framework <http://code.google.com/p/googletest/>`__
also known as Google Test. The source code for the framework is stored
in `thirdparty/gtest <https://github.com/ampl/mp/tree/master/thirdparty/gtest>`__
and built as part of the tests because it is recommended that each
project compiles Google Test itself instead of using pre-compiled libraries.
See `Google Test FAQ <http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/FAQ>`__
for more details.

The `INSTALL file <https://github.com/ampl/mp/blob/master/INSTALL>`__ contains
instructions on building and running the tests.
